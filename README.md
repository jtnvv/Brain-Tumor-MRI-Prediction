# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Prediction
We developed a classification model that allows us to determine the type of tumor (glioma, meningioma, pituitary) or, if there is no tumor, we achieved an accuracy of 0.99 in the Kaggle competition and a score of 0.99.  In this case, we used transfer learning modeling to find the best solution, using Resnet50 and EfficientNetB4.
furthermore.
In addition, we compared the results between EfficientnetB4 and Google Studio AI to determine which one performs better in the rankings.
